First week project for Skill Distillery

		This project reads a price and amount tendered and prints the 
		change due in each denomination.

	

* I prompted the user for the cash values that can be inputed and saved as a variable
* I made some if statements to match the description of the HW that filtered if the user paid too much or too less
* I made an else statement to close out that code block if the amount provided and needed was equal
